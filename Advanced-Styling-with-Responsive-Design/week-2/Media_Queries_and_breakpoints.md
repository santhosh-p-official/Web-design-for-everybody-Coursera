# Week Two Review: Media Queries and breakpoints

### Question 1
Consider the following CSS rules:

    div{
       width: 80%;
    }

    @media all and (min-width: 500px){
        div{
           width: 25%;
        }
    }

What is the width of any div elements on a 350px screen?

    1) 25%
    2) 80%
    3) 100%

_ANS: 2) 80%_<hr>
