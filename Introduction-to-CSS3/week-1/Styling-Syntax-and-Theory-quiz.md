# Styling Syntax and Theory

### Question 1
Which of the following is not an option for specifying a color in CSS3?

    1) hexadecimal
    2) rgba
    3) rgb
    4) binary
    5) color name
    
_ANS: 4) binary_<hr>

### Question 2
If your body tag uses the style attribute style="text-align:center", you can overwrite that property by using the CSS3 rule.

    body{
       text-align: left;
    }
<br>

    1) True
    2) False

_ANS: 2) False_<hr>

### Question 3
What is wrong with the following code?

    body{
       color: #000000;
       background-color:#FFFFFF
       font-family: Times, Arial, Cursive;
    }
<br>

    1) There is a missing semicolon
    2) You can't style three properties in a single rule
    3) This is a valid rule
    
_ANS: 1) There is a missing semicolon_<hr>

### Question 4
Assume the following rule is the only one that styles the body element:

    body{
       font-family: Cursive, Helvetica, Verdana;
    }
What happens if the browser doesn't support Cursive or Helvetica?


    1) The text will not be displayed
    2) The text will be displayed in Verdana
    3) The text will be displayed in Cursive
    
_ANS: 2) The text will be displayed in Verdana_<hr>
